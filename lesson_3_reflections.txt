When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When there are others developers involved and when those are rather far frome me.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Well, since I may prefer to create a new branch on my local repository or may be to check first changes made on Git Hub.
  
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

  A fork is a clone of another repository made in GitHub rather than in my local. Clone is the same thing but made on my local. 
  And branches are made inside only one repository

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
  This way you can always decide to merge both versions
  
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
